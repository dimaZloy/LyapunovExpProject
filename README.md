Part 1. 
Heat transfer effects on the turbulent bluff-body wake dynamics for the flow over a semicircular cylinder at Re = 100,000 and M  = 0.12. 2D URANS calculations with a simple SA model was done using OpenFOAM v211. Wake dynamics is supressed significantly: St =0.4 vs St = 0.1, which is accomponied by increasing of the drag force and recirculation zone length, 
and decreasing of the lift force.
